## üìù Assessment Guidelines

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 24 hours from the time of receipt (9AM Sunday, 13/07/25).
- üß† **Objective**: Statistically evaluate the provided dataset(s) and solve both problems using exploratory data analysis and logical reasoning.
- Sample output files have been added with the bare minimum information. However, we would like to see you tailor it professionally and add any other relevant details to enrich the context and information (Bonus points for that!)
- In case you are unclear about any part of the question, you can make logical assumptions (we will evaluate on those as well). Do ensure to clearly document such assumptions in the code or text files expected from you. 
- ‚úÖ **Both problems are mandatory** to attempt:
  - **Problem 1** carries **70% weightage**
  - **Problem 2** carries **30% weightage**
- üßÆ **Passing Criteria**:
  - Evaluation will consider both:
    - The **accuracy of final outputs**
    - The **quality of supporting documentation** (notebooks, reasoning, scripts)
- üß™ **Evaluation Includes**:
  - Final mapping or analysis results
  - Thought process and justifications
  - Visualizations and statistical reasoning
  - Validation or correctness checks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes on Integrity

- Submissions will be passed through **anti-plagiarism and LLM-generated content detection systems**.
- Any indication of **copy-paste from AI tools or code reuse** without proper justification will result in automated **disqualification**.
- Your explanations must demonstrate clear **original thinking and statistical analysis**.

### üì¶ Submission Format

- Package your solutions for each problem in a folder named:
  ```
  assessment_01/
  assessment_02/
  ```
- Bundle both folders into a single ZIP file named:
  ```
  solution_<college>_<underscore_separated_firstnames_of_team_members>.zip
  ```
  **Example**:
  ```
  solution_iitd_ravi_ayesha_neha.zip
  ```

### üìß Submission Deadline

- Submit your final zip file via email having a title starting with *SOLUTION - <COLLEGE>_ <underscore_separated_firstnames_of_team_members> and send it to:
  ```
  dmr-intern-assessments@aptportfolio.com
  ```
- **Deadline**: **Before 9:00 AM on Monday (14/Jul/25)**  
  A strict **15-minute grace period** is allowed for any unanticipated network delays. Late submissions beyond 9:15 AM will be disqualified.

### üí° Tips

- Ensure all code runs without error from a clean environment.
- Include a `README.md` or short note for each assessment folder if helpful.
- Label your charts, plots, and outputs clearly.
- Good to have - include a requirements.txt in case you are using a virtual environment in order for us to evaluate better.
